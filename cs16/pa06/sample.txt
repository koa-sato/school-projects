    "And thanks to all those science projects, I acquired a central
ability that was to help me through my entire career: patience.
I'm serious. Patience is usually so underrated. I mean, for all
those projects, from third grade all the way to eighth grade, I just
learned things gradually, figuring out ... how to do things
one tiny little step at a time. I learned to not worry so much about
the outcome, but to concentrate on the step I was on and to try
to do it as perfectly as I could when I was doing it.

    Not everyone gets this in today's engineering community, you
know. Throughout my career at Apple and other places, you
always find a lot of geeks who try to reach levels without doing
the in-between ones first, and it won't work. It never does. That's
just cognitive development, plain and simple. You can't teach
somebody two cognitive steps above from where you are
... I taught later on. I kept telling them, like a mantra:
One step at a time."
